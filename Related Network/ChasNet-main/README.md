**- Pre-Trained models**

The pre-trained model for track-2 (i.e. scaling of x2) is shared with the repository while the pre-trained model for the track-1 (i.e. scaling of x4) can be downloaded from the [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jpCZn1bDX2qSUKYc_2Q5bpBGsF_p0sCr/view?usp=sharing).

**- Training the model**

To train from scratch, you need to set root directory and dataset directory into `options/train/train_vkgenPSNR.json` file. Then run the following command to start the training.
```javascript
python train.py -opt PATH-to-json_file

```

**- Testng the model**

To test your pre-trained model, you need to set root directory and dataset directory into `options/test/test_VKGen.json` file. Then run the following command to start the training.
```javascript
python test.py -opt PATH-to-json_file

```
To get the SR images using self-assemble technique, you need to run the following line of code.
```javascript
python self_assemble_test.py -opt PATH-to-json_file

```

**- Requirement of packages**

The list of packages required to run the code is given in `chasnet.yml` file.

We are thankful to Xinntao for their ESRGAN code using which this work has been implemented.
